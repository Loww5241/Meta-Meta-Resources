Below is a running list of university-level psychology and neuroscience classes with open syllabi and video recordings. It's worth noting that these resources are specifically meant to complement the resources (such as [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/ocwsearch.htm)) already included in the [Mason OER Metafinder](https://oer.deepwebaccess.com/oer/desktop/en/search.html), which is linked from the [Overview page of the Free Online Learning Overview section](/online-learning-opportunities/overview).
